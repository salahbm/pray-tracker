# Prayer Tracker Mobile

This is a fresh Expo application bootstrapped for the Prayer Tracker project. The source code lives in the `src` directory and is configured to use [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) for styling with Tailwind CSS syntax.

## Available scripts

- `bun start` / `bun android` / `bun ios` / `bun web`

Replace `bun` with your preferred package manager command to run the Expo CLI.

## NativeWind

Tailwind classes can be used via the `className` prop on React Native components. Update `tailwind.config.js` to customize the design tokens as needed.
