- iOS/Android development environment for mobile app

### First-time Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prayer-tracker.git
cd prayer-tracker
```

2. Install dependencies at the repository root (this links every workspace)

```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up environment variables

```bash
# Copy environment files in each app directory
cp apps/mobile/.env.example apps/mobile/.env
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
```

### Available Scripts

From the root directory Turborepo orchestrates workspace commands:

- `bun run build` – Build every package and application (respecting dependencies)
- `bun run dev` – Start backend, mobile, and web dev servers in parallel
- `bun run lint` – Lint all workspaces that expose a `lint` script
- `bun run test` – Run tests across applications
- `bun run typecheck` – Execute TypeScript checks for all workspaces

You can target a specific workspace with Turborepo filters, e.g. `bun run build --filter=@prayer/backend`.

## 📦 Shared Packages

### @prayer/shared

Common utilities and types used across applications live in `packages/shared`.

- Built via `bun run build --filter=@prayer/shared`
- Resolved through the `@prayer/shared` package name inside each app
- Compiled output is written to `packages/shared/dist`
